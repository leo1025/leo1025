Hi, call me Leona.

I'm a Digital Artist and Programmer based in Kentucky. I studied at Dartmouth College for Computer Science and Digital Arts. I don't write a whole lot of code any more, but I mostly enjoy just making cool little experiments or learning about new tools. I like to keep my repositories documented with resources and tips, so feel free to make use of them as you please.
